# Java OOPs Projects Repository

A collection of **Core Java projects** demonstrating **Object-Oriented Programming** concepts and practical applications. This repository showcases mini-projects built using Java fundamentals and OOPs principles.

## 📚 Repository Overview
This repository contains Java projects developed to practice and demonstrate core programming concepts. Each project focuses on different aspects of **OOPs principles** and real-world problem-solving using Java.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Language:** Core Java (JDK 8+)
- **Concepts:** OOPs (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction)
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / VS Code
- **Development:** Console-based applications

## 📁 Current Projects

### 1. **Bill Generator System** ✅
- **Folder:** `/bill-generator/`
- **Description:** A comprehensive billing system that generates invoices and manages customer transactions
- **OOPs Concepts Used:**
  - **Encapsulation:** Private data members with getter/setter methods
  - **Inheritance:** Different types of bills (e.g., retail, wholesale)
  - **Abstraction:** Abstract billing classes and interfaces
- **Features:**
  - Product/service addition to bills
  - Bill generation and printing
  - Total amount calculation

### 2. **Car ShowRoom Mangement** ✅
- **Folder:** showroom-management-system/

- **Description:** A comprehensive showroom management system that handles automotive dealership operations including showroom registration, employee management, and car inventory tracking through an interactive console interface
- **OOPs Concepts Used:**
  - **Encapsulation:** Private data members in Showroom, Employee, and Cars classes with controlled access through get_details() and set_details() methods
  - **Inheritance:**Employee and Cars classes extend the base Showroom class, inheriting common attributes and behaviors
  - **Abstraction:** utility interface defines abstract methods (get_details() and set_details()) that must be implemented by all classes
  - **Polymorphism**: Method overriding where each class provides its own specific implementation of inherited abstract methods
- **Features:**
  - Showroom Management
  - Employee Management
  - Car Inventory System
  - nteractive Console Interface





## 🔮 Future Projects (Coming Soon)
- **Student Management System**
- **Library Management System**
- **Banking Application**


## 🔧 Prerequisites
- **Java JDK 8** or higher
- Basic understanding of **Java syntax**
- Knowledge of **OOPs concepts**
- Any **Java IDE** or text editor
- **Command line** familiarity
